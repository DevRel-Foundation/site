		<h2>Accelerating Technology Adoption</h2>

		<p>
			The mission of the <strong>Developer Relations Foundation</strong> (DRF) is to elevate the professional practices of Developer Relations and increase the effectiveness of the function within organizations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Developer Relations is a critical discipline that bridges the gap between technology providers and developer communities. It encompasses a range of activities including community engagement, technical support, education, evangelism and advocacy that enable the successful adoption of technology.

		<h2>Our Vision</h2>

		<p>
			Our vision is to establish the DevRel Foundation as a credible, central force in advancing the practices of Developer Relations, elevating its value to businesses and organizations. We aim to elevate foundational standards and foster a vibrant, accessible community that actively shapes and grows the discipline.
		</p>

		<p>
			To bring this vision to life, the DRF will serve as a formally established entity that anchors the community's collective efforts. We will provide a centralized, open-access hub for high-quality materials, frameworks, and guidance, sourced from proven individual contributions and driven by focused innovation.
		</p>

		<p>
			To support the mission, we plan to collaboratively develop assets, including definitions, frameworks, and the creation and codification of other artifacts that aid the success of Developer Relations practitioners around the world.
