		<h1>Working Groups</h1>

		<p>
			Our working groups are short-term, highly focused collaborations that tackle real challenges
			and opportunities in developer relations. Designed to be agile and achievable, they operate
			under two distinct tracks:
		</p>

		<h2>Sourcing Working Groups</h2>
		<p>
			These groups curate proven frameworks, models, templates, and resources from across the DevRel
			ecosystem. By consolidating what already works, sourcing groups ensure that early to
			mid-career DevRel professionals have access to tested, trustworthy guidance they can use
			immediately.
		</p>

		<h3>Examples of sourcing deliverables:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A repository of developer onboarding playbooks</li>
			<li>Comparative guides to community engagement platforms</li>
			<li>Collections of DevRel KPIs and success metrics</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Innovation Working Groups</h2>
		<p>
			These are experimental, time-boxed initiatives designed to fill gaps in the field. Each
			innovation working group is launched around a clearly defined problem statement and aims to
			produce new materials that advance the practice.
		</p>

		<h3>Examples of innovation deliverables:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Emerging models for measuring DevRel ROI in AI-driven communities</li>
			<li>Inclusive community engagement frameworks for global audiences</li>
			<li>Case studies of non-traditional DevRel team structures</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			All outputs are managed via <a href="https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation">GitHub</a> and organized
			by theme for community access and contribution.
		</p>

		<h2>Why Working Groups Matter</h2>
		<p>
			The DRF's working groups are how we capture and advance its best thinking, by sharing what
			works, building what's missing, and supporting each other through the process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our mission is to empower early-stage and mid-career DevRel professionals with the tools,
			knowledge, and confidence they need to succeed. Working groups are a cornerstone of that
			mission.
		</p>

		<h2>Who Should Join?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>New and mid-career DevRel professionals seeking guidance and frameworks</li>
			<li>Organizations launching or scaling DevRel functions</li>
			<li>
				Experienced DevRel leaders looking to mentor, contribute expertise, or shape the field
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Whether you're sharing a battle-tested template or helping define tomorrow's best practices,
			there's a place for you here.
		</p>

		<h2>How It Works</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Working groups are formed on a rolling basis.</li>
			<li>Each group is time-bound, with clearly scoped objectives.</li>
			<li>
				Contributors can participate asynchronously and collaboratively through GitHub and community
				meetings.
			</li>
			<li>Outputs are openly published and maintained as living resources.</li>
		</ul>
