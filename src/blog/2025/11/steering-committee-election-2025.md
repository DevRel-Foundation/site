The DevRel Foundation has completed its first election cycle since its full formation in August 2025, and we’re pleased to share the results.

Congratulations to new members Arun Gupta, Tabs Fakier, and Divya Mohan, and continuing member Stacey Kruczek. They will join Jayson DeLancey, Wesley Faulkner, and Aditya Oberai, whose terms will conclude on November 1, 2026.

The [DRF Steering Committee](https://dev-rel.org/about/steering-committee) is responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Foundation, including:

- Strategic direction
- Working group formation and approval
- Role definitions and criteria
- Setting community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies
- Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing

More information on the Steering Committee’s responsibilities, and election criteria and processes, are in the [Foundation’s charter](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/Technical_Charter.adoc).

A heartfelt gratitude to outgoing members Katie Miller, Jonathan LeBlanc and Phil Leggetter. Their leadership and expertise in Developer Relations, foundation governance, and community building contributed to the successful formation of the organization, including the processes and policies to ensure leadership continuity year over year.
