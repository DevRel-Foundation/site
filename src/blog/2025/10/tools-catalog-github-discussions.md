A **community** is a group of people who come together online or in-person because they share a common interest, goal, or trait. For online communities, having a forum or place to have conversations in the proverbial village square is a common need for DevRel practitioners trying to support their community. One of the tools to accomplish this task is [GitHub Discussions](/projects/tools-catalog/explore?tool=github.com.features-discussions).

In this article, you'll learn how to set up and manage [GitHub Discussions](/projects/tools-catalog/explore?tool=github.com.features-discussions) for your developer community, including some best practices and tips.

## Getting Started with GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions was introduced in 2020 in order to support community-driven conversations. This solves a few big problems for developer communities.

- separates developer questions from the GitHub Issues used to track bugs and feature requests
- creates an additional knowledge base about a project that grows over time
- allows community polling and voting on ideas
- keeps the community forums together in the same location with source code and doesn't require separate infrastructure or accounts
- platform many developers are already comfortable with and have accounts
- no additional budget needed to use it

The [Resources Working Group](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions) of the DevRel Foundation is using GitHub Discussions for these reasons.

GitHub Discussions may not be your ideal tool if you have constraints such as:

- want to collect user sign ups
- not comfortable with discussions being in public

## Consideration: User Accounts

One limitations of GitHub Discussions is account management.

If you want to be able to email everybody in your community, GitHub Discussions does not allow you to get email addresses unless participants have opted to share them publicly.

If you want to let your community participate in GitHub Discussions using the same account as your SaaS, PaaS, or user accounts then you would need to use social login with OAuth in order to correlate user accounts.

## Consideration: Scoping Your Community Discussions

Typically on GitHub, you'll have a one to many relationship of an **organization** to **repositories**. You can enable GitHub Discussions on each individual repository but you can only have one for the organization overall. 

This can be a source of confusion for your community if discussions are happening in multiple places unless the repositories are for projects that are very distinct. 

## Recommendation: A Community Repos for Your Organization

A recommended approach to setting up discussions for your technical community.

### 1. Create a `community` repository

Create a new repository and consider naming it `community`.

Go into the **Settings** for this new repository and enable Discussions. 

For this repository, you may also consider disabling some of the other features that you likely won't use like **Issues** and **Projects**. This helps simplify navigation on GitHub so that the discussions area stands out. You may also want to add and update the README.md linking to the discussions, adding a code of conduct, and other best practices for communities outside the scope of this article.

### 2. Enable Discussions for Your Organization Overall

You'll need to have admin access for the organization overall. Go into the settings and locate discussions and choose your new community repository.

See the GitHub Docs:
* <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-an-organization#enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-your-organization" target="_blank">Enable GitHub Discussions for Your Organization</a>

### 3. Consolidate Discussions Across Organization

Once you've set up your community repository, it's important to consolidate discussions to avoid confusion.

Check for any other repositories with discusisons enabled but inactive or not used much. You should disable them to avoid confusing your community on where to find activity and get responses.

## Recommendation: Customize Discussion Categories

You'll start with an initial set of categories: Announcements, General, Ideas, Polls, Q&A, Show and tell.

Here's a screenshot of what that looks like:

For many organizations this may be a fine place to start. If you have folks in your community who may not share a common interest, this may result in a lot of discussions being mixed together about very different subjects. 

For example, with the DevRel Foundation we are part of one community, but somebody interested in the [Tools Catalog](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/tools-catalog) may not have any interest in the [Persona Library](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/persona-library). Using separate categories would be a way of offering a filter when projects are unrelated.

You might consider using a separate category for each repository, so while there is a single common community discussion groups, each repository can still carve off its own focused area.

## Recommendation: Use Pinned Discussion Messages Effectively

Create a message and call it something like "Welcome! How-to Get Started Here". Include a succinct introduction so that when somebody first finds your GitHub Discussions they know where to begin.

In your welcome, make sure to cover:

- [ ] explain what the community is
- [ ] point people to code of conduct or any rules for participation
- [ ] provide links to tutorials or other introductory materials or posts

## Recommendation: Identify a Community Manager for Discussions

You'll want to identify somebody accountable for managing the GitHub Discussions. They should be expected to do a few things:

- [ ] make sure questions are answered
- [ ] listen to feedback and adjust categories as needed
- [ ] provide discussion prompts to solicit community feedback

Make sure they turn on GitHub notifications and update their email settings so they are aware of when discussions are created. GitHub notifications can be noisy to manage if you watch all activity in a repository including PRs, commits, issues, and discussions.

## Conclusion

Particularly for open source communities using GitHub Discussions can be a very quick and easy win for giving your community a place to ask questions, vote on polls, and other forms of engagement.

There are other advanced things you can do with GitHub Discussions that we can cover in other learning resources. You could use GitHub Discussions for collecting and ranking community feedback, for providing customer support workflows, and more.

You can even use GitHub Discussions to allow your community to respond to content. So head over to our [Tools Catalog Discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/categories/tools-catalog) if you have feedback or contributions to this post.
