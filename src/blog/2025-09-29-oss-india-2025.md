Developer Relations (DevRel) has become a critical function in the tech industry, acting as the essential bridge between companies and their technical communities. But for all its importance, the profession is often misunderstood, undervalued, and fragmented.

On August 5th, 2025, wetook the stage at the Open Source Summit India in Hyderabad to address these challenges head-on and to officially introduce the **Developer Relations Foundation (DRF)** ahead of its formation at the Open Source Summit Europe.

## What (really) is DevRel?

**If you ask 10 DevRel professionals what "DevRel" means, you will probably get 10 different answers.**

In fact, wetried asking the same at the Open Source Summit and received quite the range of answers:

DevRel professionals tend to wear many hats, which can often change from employer to employer. However, the DRF has attempted to consolidate the outcomes of these different responsibilities in a single definition:

> **Developer Relations** is the practice of building and nurturing relationships with external and internal teams through community engagement, technical support, education, and advocacy to enable the successful adoption of an organization's developer products and drive business value.

In simpler terms, DevRel professionals ensure that developers have the resources, support, and voice they need to succeed with a product. They are the advocates for the developer within the company, translating feedback into product improvements, and the advocates for the company within the community, fostering trust and enabling growth.

## Is DevRel a profession at risk?

Despite its strategic importance, **DevRel faces an existential crisis** today. The profession has lately been one of the first to face cuts when budgets tighten because its value is not always immediately visible to leadership.

This stems from a fundamental disconnect between leadership and DevRel teams. Leadership often only sees the **tangible outputs of DevRel**: blog posts, webinars, documentation, and closed GitHub issues. These are viewed as tactical tasks, easily measured but not always seen as strategic. 

The true value of DevRel lies in the work that happens **behind the scenes**. This includes capturing product friction, building trust through genuine user empathy, identifying adoption blockers, and evangelizing the platform internally. This invisible work, which is anyway a direct or indirect consequence of the visible work, is what drives long-term retention and growth.

With the rise of AI and automation, there also is a growing perception that the "visible" parts of DevRel can be replaced. The truth is that **AI can't replicate the core of the profession**. AI can answer *how*, but not *why I trust this platform*. **Automation can't replace trust, feedback loops, or community value.**

At its heart, **DevRel is about human connection**, which is the bedrock of the long-term sustenance of developer products and communities.

## How the Developer Relation Foundation affects the scenario

To address this industry-wide fragmentation and lack of a unified standard, the intent to form a Developer Relations Foundation under the Linux Foundation was announced in 2024. Since then, **the DRF has fully launched** (this year at Open Source Summit Europe) as an **open-source, community-led organization with a clear mission:**

> **To elevate the professional practice of developer relations and increase awareness of it as a driver of business value.**

Born from community conversations during a period of industry-wide layoffs and uncertainty, the DRF aims to create an impartial entity that provides resources, support, and governance for the entire DevRel community.

### Purpose of having a foundation

The purpose of having a foundation relies on three key pillars:

- **Inclusive:** The DRF is for everyone in a DevRel (and adjacent) role, regardless of their official job title or organization.
- **Neutral:** As a community-driven entity, it remains vendor-agnostic, focusing on principles and practices that benefit the entire industry.
- **Continuity:** Governed by a public charter and working groups, the foundation is built to last, ensuring its initiatives can evolve and continue over time.

### Benefits of joining the foundation

By joining the DRF, members can expect to see a direct impact on their careers and the industry as a whole. The key benefits include:

- **Industry Impact:** Contribute to defining the standards, practices, and metrics that will shape the future of DevRel.
- **Career Growth:** Gain access to mentorship, training, and a global network of peers to advance your professional journey.
- **Practical Resources:** Access exclusive resources, workshops, and real-world case studies to solve common challenges and implement best practices in your own work.

### Active initiatives in the foundation

Members of the DRF are actively working on several open-source projects that aim to standardize and improve DevRel practices across the industry. These projects are maintained at various maturity levels to encourage community participation and feedback:

- **[Tools Catalog](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/tools-catalog):** A comprehensive collection of physical and digital tools useful for evaluating DevRel programs, categorized by use case and jobs to be done.
- **[Persona Library](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/persona-library):** A reference collection for studying and standardizing developer personas, offering pragmatic advice for day-to-day go-to-market strategies.
- **[Events Directory](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/events-directory):** A directory of developer events, conferences, and meetups to enhance community engagement strategies.
- **[Metrics Index](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/metrics-index):** An index of metrics and KPIs for measuring the performance and impact of DevRel initiatives.
- **[DevRel Maturity Model](https://github.com/devrel-foundation/devrel-maturity-model):** A framework for assessing organizational maturity in executing DevRel tactics and programs.

The foundation also operates through active working groups that drive these initiatives forward:

- **[Community Engagement and Support](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-community-engagement-support):** Documents standardized approaches and frameworks that help organizations build, nurture, and scale developer communities.
- **[Resources](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation):** Innovates on building open-data tools such as the Persona Library, Tools Catalog, and Events Directory to support DevRel activities.

These working groups are public and open for anyone to join, meeting regularly to collaborate on projects that address the biggest challenges DevRel professionals face today.
