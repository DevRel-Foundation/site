With the Developer Relations Foundation, we are on a mission to elevate the professional practice of Developer Relations. 

So what _is_ Developer Relations? Here are some thoughts from around the community.

# 10 | Wikipedia

The Free Encyclopedia take on it:

> Developer relations, abbreviated as DevRel, is an umbrella term for practices employed by an organization that builds developer-facing software to connect with the developers that use that software. Developer relations is a form of platform evangelism and the activities involved are sometimes referred to as a developer program or a DevRel program.

# 09 | ZDNet

Quoted in a ZDNet article, Lorna Mitchell describes DevRel as a glue role:
> At its core, however, DevRel is about building rapport with the developer community and leveraging this to figure out how to build successful software applications. In this sense, developer relations is about closing the feedback loop and creating a bridge between the people who use the software and the wider organization

After noting the need to define DevRel is in response to employers' dissatisfaction stemming from a lack of understanding:

> Developer Relations, nicknamed DevRel for short, is a field made up of multiple roles including Developer Experience Engineers, Developer Advocates, Community Managers, Technical Writers, Developer Marketers, and more. The primary objective of a DevRel team is to facilitate communication between technologists and the business. Although many enter the field with altruistic motives, the underlying mission is to expand the customer base in a scalable, one-to-many approach.

Jono Bacon, the author of [The Art of Commmunity](https://www.jonobacon.com/books/artofcommunity/) explains:

> Developer Relations, commonly known as DevRel, is a rapidly growing field within the tech industry that focuses on fostering relationships between companies and their developer communities.  DevRel professionals bridge the gap between companies and developers by providing technical guidance, support, and resources. This allows companies to better understand the needs and perspectives of their developer communities, which ultimately drives the growth and adoption of their products and services.

Matthew Revell, known for his many valuable contributions to [DevRelCon](https://developerrelations.com/devrelcon/) writes:

> DevRel, or developer relations, is how modern companies build authentic, mutually beneficial relationships with the developers who increasingly drive technical decisions. It's no longer enough to have great technology—you need developers to discover, trust, and champion your solutions.

# 05 | Phil Leggetter

Phil shared in a blog post the mission statements of DevRel teams from some well known tech companies.

**Google**:
> Developer Relations’ role is to create a vibrant ecosystem of 3rd party developers, by being the interface between those developers and your platform’s product, engineering, and design teams.


**Twilio**:
> Our job is to inspire and equip developers to build the next generation of amazing applications. This means understanding what they are trying to do, pointing them to tools and training and generally helping them be successful.

# 04 | Caroline Lewko and James Parton

From the authors of [Developer Relations: How to Build and Grow a Successful Developer Program](https://www.devrel.agency/book) :

> Developer Relations is enabling a developer to be successful with your product, while aligning with your corporate goals.

# 03 | Mary Thengvall

From the author of [The Business Value of Developer Relations](https://www.persea-consulting.com/book) in a blog post:

> At its foundation, the purpose of Developer Relations is to build relationships with and enable our technical communities. DevRel professionals act as a liaison between their company and the technical audience—typically the end users of the product.

# 02 | Tribute

This is not the greatest definition of DevRel in the world, this is just a tribute in memoriam. 

There have been dozens of blog posts published defining Developer Relations by influential advocates, evangelists, and leaders. Many of these definitions now return a `404`. 

A key value of the [Developer Relations Foundation](/join-us) is to provide continuity so that as individuals change roles, companies, or opinions we still have an open source resource through the support of the Linux Foundation.

# 01 | Us

Finally, this may not be the most auspicious way to conclude this post but maybe we've gotten it all wrong. As an industry and profession, we've focused on trying to define Developer Relations. Instead, we could have been trying to standardize it.

> “I have built, led, and nurtured developer communities for over two decades. Having a foundation dedicated to the function of DevRel provides a third-party, neutral and global stage to bring all devrel folks together. I’m looking forward to all the exciting work to elevate the function of devrel and its business impact, a common language to talk about different functions, and metrics to measure the success”

The [DevRel Foundation Steering Committee](/about/steering-committee) created a [definition](/learn/what-is-devrel) last year but it is just a start. We need to expand upon this definition and invite public comment for an open project and standard for how we communicate about and achieve business value as DevRel regardless of organization and job title.

[Join us](/join-us) in a working group meeting or community call to find out how you can contribute. On some points about DevRel we may differ but can still disagree and `git commit` for the good of all in this role.
