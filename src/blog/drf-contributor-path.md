The mission of the DevRel Foundation (DRF) is to elevate the professional practice of developer relations and increase awareness of it as a driver of business value. Whether you’re just discovering DRF or already active in the community, 
here’s a contributor path that can help you grow. This path aims to give people space to start small, build confidence, and eventually step into leadership if they choose.  

# The Contributor Ladder at DRF

Like many open source communities, DRF has a natural progression of involvement.  

**Lurkers → Participants → Contributors → Project and/or  Working Group Leads → Steering Committee**  

Each step is valuable, and people contribute at the level that best fits their time, skills, and goals.  

## Step 1: Getting Started

At the beginning, contribution often means **listening and learning**. You might join a working group Discord channel, read through GitHub issues, or sit in on a working group call. Even something as simple as leaving a reaction or a short comment helps show support and engagement.  

## Step 2: Becoming a Contributor

Contributions can be big or small. You might fix a typo, share a link in a discussion, or help clarify the requirements for an open issue. Reviewing a pull request or writing a short document are also great ways to add value.  

You don’t need to be technical to contribute. Non-technical contributions, such as feedback, ideas, or community support, are just as important.  

For inspiration, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md in the Tools Catalog](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/tools-catalog/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#types-of-contributions).  

## Step 3: Becoming a Working Group Leader

As you contribute more, you may want to take on a working group-level role. This could mean coordinating calls, guiding projects, and ensuring contributors feel supported and welcome.

It could also involve writing tutorials, drafting knowledge base articles, or defining key DevRel concepts with the community.

## Step 4: Submitting Your Nomination for the Steering Committee (SC)

The SC is responsible for setting DRF’s strategic direction and ensuring alignment across working groups. This role requires a broader perspective, collaboration across working groups, and a focus on sustaining the foundation’s mission for the long term.
If you’ve grown into working group leadership and want to expand your impact, you can submit a nomination when elections open every year. Nominations are announced to the community, giving anyone who has been actively contributing a chance to step forward.  

## Additional Community Support

If you’re curious about getting involved, you can book a [1:1 call with one of our current Steering Committee members](https://calendar.app.google/2XvRuX6EbJjih6HD7) to talk through opportunities.
