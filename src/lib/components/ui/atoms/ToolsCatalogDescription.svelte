    The <strong>DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog</strong> is more than a just a list. It is an open data repository and schema for collecting physical and digital tools of interest to the Developer Relations community. Tools are created so they can be explored by jobs to be done with a knowledge base of evaluation criteria and learning resources for applying the tool to the task.
