## Getting Started

The DevRel Foundation website serves as the central hub for information about our community, hosting resources, blog content, and wayfinding to our working groups and projects. All contributions should align with our mission to provide valuable, vendor-neutral resources for the Developer Relations community.

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, please ensure you have:
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub workflows

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [DevRel Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/governance/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment.

## Ways to Contribute

### Blog Posts

Share insights, tutorials, and perspectives on Developer Relations Foundation topics that highlight the value that the community and resources provide.

See more details below about contributing blog posts because we are looking for blog posts that support the mission of the foundation. A good litmus test for the content we seek is that it references something created for the DevRel Foundation.

### Bug Reports
Found an issue with the website? Report it through a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/site/issues) to make sure we're aware.

### Feature Requests
Suggest new features or improvements to enhance the site's functionality. This is a volunteer project so should set expectations accordingly. Reporting an issue is still helpful to understand what is valuable, building it is divine if you have the skill and time.

### Documentation
Help improve our documentation, guides, and resources. If you are confused by anything you encounter, that is likely a good opportunity to ask questions and then improve upon it for everybody who comes along later.

### Design & UX
Contribute to the visual design and user experience of the site.

### Code Contributions
Help develop new features, fix bugs, or improve the site's technical implementation.
